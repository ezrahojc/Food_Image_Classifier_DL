# Deep Learning Assignment 1
This assignment was completed in Year 2 as an elective module. I thoroughly enjoyed my time working on models and constantly learning to train models and achieving greater sentiment and predictive analysis, translating into more accurate predictions of emotions and characters respectively for Part 1 and Part 2 of this assignment.
As much as I want to showcase my models here, it was ruined in a hard drive failure and was unfortunately unable to recover my work. However, please check out the report I've written for my full thought process and workings of this assignment.



# Assignment 1 : Food Classifier Model
This model aims to classify the food which has been distributed to us randomly. When I first recieved the dataset, I cleaned the dataset and proceeded to sort it out to practice and test images for the model. I enjoyed working on this since it was a really hands on module and am interested in the maths and algorithms behind machine learning.
